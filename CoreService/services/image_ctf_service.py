# The Contrast Transfer Function (CTF) is a mathematical function that describes the distortion of the electron microscope image due to various factors such as the microscope's optics and the sample's interaction with the electron beam. The CTF is a measure of how well the microscope can transfer the contrast information of the sample to the image.

# The CTF is an important consideration in electron microscopy as it affects the resolution and quality of the final image. By understanding and accounting for the CTF, it is possible to improve the resolution and quality of the image.
